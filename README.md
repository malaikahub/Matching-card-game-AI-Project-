🏁 1. Introduction
🔹 1.1 Background

The Memory Card Matching Game (Concentration) is a classic puzzle where players match pairs of identical cards. Traditionally, it’s played with physical cards, but this project modernizes it into a digital Python-based game using Tkinter for a fun and interactive experience.

It features:

🕒 Real-time timer

🔄 Restart button

🎯 Move counter

💡 Instant feedback and user interaction

🎯 1.2 Objective of the Project

The main goals of this project are:

🧩 Modern Features: Add interactivity through a timer, move counter, and restart option.

🎨 Engaging Interface: Create a simple and visually appealing GUI.

🧠 Cognitive Development: Encourage strategic thinking, attention, and memory.

🚀 Scalability: Allow future expansion with AI opponents, multiplayer, and difficulty levels.

🧘‍♀️ 1.3 Importance of Cognitive Skills

The game strengthens key mental abilities:

🔍 Attention: Remember card positions under time pressure.

🧩 Problem Solving: Plan efficient moves to win with fewer attempts.

💭 Memory: Improves short-term and long-term recall through repetition.

⚙️ 2. Methodology
🧱 2.1 Planning and Design

The classic memory game was re-created using Python and Tkinter. The player flips two cards at a time to find matches, with move tracking, a timer, and restart functionality.

🗂️ Layout and Features

🎴 Card Grid: 4x4 layout (scalable for higher difficulty).

🧮 Move Counter: Tracks number of moves.

⏱️ Timer: Displays game duration.

🔄 Restart Button: Resets the game with reshuffled cards.

🧰 Tools and Technologies

🐍 Python – Core programming language.

🖼️ Tkinter – GUI creation (buttons, labels, windows).

🔀 Random Module – Shuffles cards to ensure unique gameplay.

🔄 2.2 Game Design and Flow
🃏 Card Logic

Card Generation: Numbers (1–8 for 4x4 grid) are duplicated to form pairs.

Shuffling: random.shuffle() ensures each game is unique.

Matching: Correct pairs stay visible; incorrect ones flip back after delay.

💻 User Interface

Game Window: Displays cards, timer, and controls.

Card Display: Initially hidden (“*”), revealed when clicked.

Game Feedback: Live updates for time, moves, and results.

🔁 Game Flow

Flip two cards each turn.

Matched pairs stay revealed; unmatched pairs hide.

Win Condition: Match all pairs before move limit.

Loss Condition: Exceed move limit → “Game Over.”

💡 2.3 Implementation

Card Display & Shuffling: Cards stored in shuffled list; flipped on click.

Move Counter & Timer: Track moves and duration.

Game Conditions: Win/loss determined by moves and matched pairs.
