## ⚙️ 2. Methodology

### 🧱 2.1 Planning and Design
The classic game was re-created using **Python and Tkinter**.  
Players flip two cards per turn to find pairs, with tracking for moves, time, and restart options.

#### 🗂️ Layout and Features
- 🎴 **Card Grid:** 4x4 layout (scalable).  
- 🧮 **Move Counter:** Tracks number of player moves.  
- ⏱️ **Timer:** Displays game duration.  
- 🔄 **Restart Button:** Reshuffles and resets the game.

#### 🧰 Tools and Technologies
| 🔧 Tool              | 🧩 Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| 🐍 **Python**        | Core programming language |
| 🖼️ **Tkinter**       | GUI design and event handling |
| 🔀 **Random Module** | Shuffles cards for unique gameplay |

---

### 🔄 2.2 Game Design and Flow

#### 🃏 Card Logic
- **Card Generation:** Numbers (1–8 for 4x4 grid) are duplicated to form pairs.  
- **Shuffling:** `random.shuffle()` ensures unique arrangements.  
- **Matching:** Correct pairs stay revealed; incorrect pairs flip back after a short delay.

#### 💻 User Interface
- 🪟 Game Window: Displays cards, timer, and control buttons.  
- 🎴 Card Display: Hidden (“*”) until clicked.  
- ⚡ Feedback: Real-time updates for time, moves, and results.

#### 🔁 Game Flow
1. Flip two cards per turn.  
2. Matched pairs remain visible.  
3. Unmatched pairs hide again.  
4. **Win:** All pairs matched before move limit.  
5. **Loss:** Exceed move limit → “Game Over.”  

---

### 💡 2.3 Implementation
- 🗂️ **Card Display & Shuffling:** Cards stored in a shuffled list and revealed upon click.  
- 🎯 **Move Counter & Timer:** Track progress and duration.  
- 🧮 **Game Conditions:** Determine win/loss based on moves and matched pairs.
